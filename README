Gtranslator (-the GNOME translation making program-)

If you get this code from the git repository the easier way to build is using
gnome-builder. There's a flatpak manifest that gnome-builder uses to build all
deps and launch the application sandboxed so you don't need to worry about
dependencies.
If you want to build by hand, you should follow the meson build commands:

meson _build
ninja -C _build
ninja -C _build install
